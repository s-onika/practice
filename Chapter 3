# Exercise 3.1 Rewrite your pay computation to give the employee 1.5 times the hourly rate for hours worked above 40 hours.
# Enter Hours: 45
# Enter Rate: 10
# Pay: 475.0
# Exercise 3.2 Rewrite your pay program using try and except so that your program handles non-numeric input gracefully by printing a message and exiting the
# program. The following shows two executions of the program:
# Enter Hours: 20
# Enter Rate: nine
# Error, please enter numeric input
# Enter Hours: forty
# Error, please enter numeric input

try:
    base_hours = (float(input('Enter hours')))
    base_rate = (float(input('Enter rate')))
    baseline_pay = base_hours * base_rate

# Exercise 3.3 Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error message. If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0,
# print a grade using the following table:
# Score Grade
# >= 0.9 A
# >= 0.8 B
# >= 0.7 C
# >= 0.6 D
# < 0.6
